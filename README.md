TMTB-MCNN: Advancing Protein De Novo Design toward Transmembrane Targets through Deep Learning and Multisource Feature Fusion
=
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an escalating global health threat, with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria presenting a particularly serious clinical challenge. The unique outer membrane (OM) structure serves as a natural barrier against conventional therapeutics, so that treatment strategies become more complicated. Notably, drug development aimed at the transmembrane (TM) domains of membrane proteins remains highly limited. To overcome this bottleneck, we have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven framework for the de novo design of TM domain-targeting binders (TMTBs). Central to this framework is a multi-channel convolutional neural network (TMTB-MCNN) that integrates multiple protein features to achieve high accuracy predictions. Building on this, we established a multidimensional evaluation system to guide de novo design strategies. Leveraging this framework, binders targeting the lateral gate of BamA were successfully designed. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within a membrane environment, combined with multiscale mechanistic analysis, confirmed the structural stability and high binding potential of the candidate molecules, and revealed a novel binding mode. This study presents a new intelligent paradigm for designing therapeutics that target TM regions and offers a promising strategy to combat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
